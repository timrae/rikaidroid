# rikaidroid
Inspired by the popular "Rikaichan" plugin for desktop, this is an Android app that helps you to understand Japanese.

The app takes whatever is on the clipboard, and adds furigana to the kanji. 
The app is currently in early alpha stage, so there are still some bugs, and it's still missing some features.
